Implement the work described by the user in the spec or tickets.

If the user passes a ticket reference, fetch it from the issue tracker and state its title before starting. If the reference is ambiguous, ask.

Use read `skill://tdd` where possible, at pre-agreed seams — the seams are confirmed with the user before any test is written at them.

Run typechecking regularly, single test files regularly, and the full test suite once at the end.

Once done, read `skill://code-review` to review the work, and address what it raises.

Commit your work to the current branch.
