# Triage roles

Used by `skill://triage`. Two **category** roles:

- `bug`: something is broken
- `enhancement`: new feature or improvement

Five **state** roles:

- `needs-triage`: maintainer needs to evaluate
- `needs-info`: waiting on reporter for more information
- `ready-for-agent`: fully specified, ready for an AFK agent
- `ready-for-human`: needs human implementation
- `wontfix`: will not be actioned

For a PR, the same states read against the attached code: `ready-for-agent` means a brief is attached and an agent should take the next step on the diff; `ready-for-human` means it's ready for a human to merge.

Every triaged issue should carry exactly one category role and one state role. If state roles conflict, flag it and ask the maintainer before doing anything else.

These are canonical role names. The actual label strings used in the issue tracker may differ; the mapping lives in `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`. If it isn't there, tell the user to run `/skill:setup-matt-pocock-skills`.

## State transitions

An unlabeled issue normally goes to `needs-triage` first; from there it moves to `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, or `wontfix`. `needs-info` returns to `needs-triage` once the reporter replies. The maintainer can override at any time; flag transitions that look unusual and ask before proceeding.
