# Show what needs attention

Used by `skill://triage` when the maintainer asks what needs their attention. Query the issue tracker and present three buckets, oldest first:

1. **Unlabeled**: never triaged.
2. **`needs-triage`**: evaluation in progress.
3. **`needs-info` with reporter activity since the last triage notes**: needs re-evaluation.

When PRs are in scope, include external PRs in these buckets and tag each line `[PR]` or `[issue]`. Discovery surfaces only *external* PRs (the tracker config defines who counts as external), so a collaborator's in-flight PR is not triage work. This filter is discovery-only: an explicitly named PR is always triaged regardless of author.

Show counts and a one-line summary per item. Let the maintainer pick.
